# algorithms

## Constructing a list of un/impoortant things about algorithms. Including actual algorithms, tests for each using Mocha, Chai and Node.js with jest to check the test and --watch to keep it running.

Node terminal command:
jest [algorithmFolder]/[algorithmTestFile.js] --watch

## Q & A file with everything you ever wanted to know will be added to each folder upon completion

## Goal: The ability to identify runtime complexity.

"Describe the performance of an algorithm" -H.T.

## The big Qustion (Big O notation): 
How much more processing power/time/storage is required to run your algorithm if we double the inputs?
## NOTE on Big 0 notation:
Big 0() notation folder breaks down the more concrete way to compare algorithms. 

# Code Data structures..

# How and why I do what I do in the Q & A .txt file
