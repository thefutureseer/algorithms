# algorithms

## Constructing a list of un/impoortant things about algorithms. Including actual algorithms, tests for each using Mocha, Chai and Node.js with jest to check the test and --watch to keep it running.


Including algorithms are from Udemy course at https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure

Node terminal command:
jest [algorithmFolder]/[algorithmTestFile.js] --watch

## NOTE on Big 0 notation:
Big 0() notation folder breaks down the more concrete way to compare algorithms. 

## Goal: The ability to identify runtime complexity.

"Describe the performance of an algorithm" -H.T.

## The big Qustion: 
How much more processing power/time/storage is required to run your algorithm if we double the inputs?

#Data structures..
