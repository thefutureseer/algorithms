# algorithms

Learning from Udemy course at https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure

Constructing a list of algorithms and tests for each using Node.js jest to check the test and --watch.

Node command:
jest [algorithmFile]/[algorithmTestFile.js] --watch

NOTE on Big 0 notation folder:
Big 0() notation folder breaks down the more concrete way to compare algorithms. Goal: The ability to identify runtime complexity.
   "Describe the performance of an algorithm" -H.T.
The big Qustion: 
How much more processing power/time is required to run your algorithm if we double the inputs?

Note:
memoized fibonocci just needs to be run with a number when you call it.
