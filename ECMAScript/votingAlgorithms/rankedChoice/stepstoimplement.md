Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) algorithm. Here's the plan:

### Steps to Implement Ranked Choice Voting Algorithm:

1. **Initialize the Candidates and Ballots**:
   - Define the list of candidates/questions-option to vote on.
   - Collect ballots, each ballot indicating the voter's preferences.


2. **First Round of Counting**:
   - Count the first-choice votes for each candidate/question-option.
   - Check if any candidate/question has more than 50% of the votes. If yes, that candidate/option wins.

3. **Elimination and Redistribution**:
   - If no candidate has more than 50% of the votes, eliminate the candidate with the fewest votes.
   - Redistribute the votes of the eliminated candidate to the next preferred candidate on each ballot.

4. **Repeat the Counting**:
   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a candidate/option has more than 50% of the votes.

5. **Determine the Winner**:
   - The candidate/option who eventually gets more than 50% of the votes is declared the winner.
