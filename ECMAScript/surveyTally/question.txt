UPDATE: count majority vote for highschool forever.

Code outline:
1. json is a string but the structure 
of an object so first -parse- turn it into a 
javascript object keys and values.
2. Create an object to keep track
of all the keys 
that we will be counting.
3. Loop over the object recursively over
the keys to count
4. Count the keys
5. Display the results. return or console.log the results
