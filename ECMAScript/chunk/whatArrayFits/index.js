//Given an array of numbers
//How many numbers in the array can we return
//Before going over the given maximum target number

//psuedo code 
//#1 can take all the first numbers until one pushes over but that
//might not squeeze as many as possible in to the returned array

//#2 can order the numbers in the array from smallest to largest
// and take all the smallest first that way we have the most numbers

//#3 we can pick and choose what we want in the returned array until
//it reaches the maximum allowed.

//Note: we can write tests first with jest
