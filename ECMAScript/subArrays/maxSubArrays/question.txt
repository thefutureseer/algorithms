Given an array of integers, get 
the highest sum of consecutive 
numbers in an array. If not consecutive 
then it shouldnt be counted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.


Psuedocode:
1. Varables for MaxSubArray, CurrentSubArray
2. Function to look for consecutive numbers
3. If the next number is 
 consecutive then add it to the 
 previous number and set it to CurrentSubArray.
4. If the number is not consecutive 
 to the previous number stop counting 
5. check if number of CurrentSubArray 
is larger than MaxSubArray if yes then
set MaxSubArray as CurrentSubArray
