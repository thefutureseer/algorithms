# Intuition / forethought
 1. My first thoughts on how to solve this problem:
I know set and get operations will need to be implemented. 
Set and get operations are the core functionality 
of the Time-Based Key-Value Store problem. They are 
necessary because the problem requires the storage and 
retrieval of key-value pairs along with timestamps. 

# Approach
 2. My approach to solving the problem:
designing a key-value store that supports two operations:

Use a plain JavaScript object or a hashmap to store 
the key-value pairs and a balanced tree 
(e.g. AVL tree/hashmap libraries) or a 
self-balancing tree (e.g. Red-black tree) to 
store the timestamps.

  1. set(string key, string value, int timestamp) : 
stores the key and value, along with a timestamp indicating 
when the value was set.

  2. get(string key, int timestamp): returns the value of 
the key at the given timestamp, or returns "null" if 
the key has not been set or the timestamp is less than 
the earliest timestamp stored for the key.

Note: 
JavaScript has built-in Map and Set classes that 
can be used to implement a hashmap and set respectively 
and also has support for Map and Set with a timestamp in 
the Map class, but the performance is not as good as using 
a balanced tree to store the timestamps.

# Complexity
 3 A. Time complexity:
Time complexity for both set and get operations is O(log n)

 3 B. Space complexity:
O(n), where n is the total number of key-value pairs. 
The hashmap will take O(n) space to store n key-value 
pairs and the tree will take O(n) space to store n timestamps.

It is important to note that this is the **worst-case 
space complexity. The actual space complexity will depend on 
the distribution of the keys and timestamps, and it can be 
less than O(n) if the keys and timestamps are not uniformly 
distributed. For example, if the keys are distributed such 
that some keys are more common than others, then the hashmap 
will not need to store all n key-value pairs, and the actual 
space complexity will be less than O(n). Similarly, if the 
timestamps are distributed such that some timestamps are more 
common than others, then the balanced tree will not need to 
store all n timestamps, and the actual space complexity will 
be less than O(n).

4 A. Data structures:
Two main data structures. 
 1. Hashmap to store key-value pairs, and 
 2. a balanced tree to store timestamps in order to efficiently 
store and retrieve key-value pairs along with timestamps.

4 B. kind of algorithm:
SEARCH / HASH 

4 C. Breaking down how to solve this algorithm (subproblems):
 1. Storing key-value pairs with timestamps: 
The algorithm needs to store key-value pairs where the keys 
are timestamps and the values are the values associated with 
the corresponding timestamp.

 2. Sorting the key-value pairs: 
The algorithm needs to maintain 
a sorted list of key-value pairs in order to perform efficient 
search operations.

 3. Inserting key-value pairs: 
The algorithm needs to provide a method for inserting key-value 
pairs into the store.

 4. Retrieving values associated with a given timestamp: 
The algorithm needs to provide a method for retrieving the 
value associated with a given timestamp.

 5. Searching for the key-value pair with the largest
    timestamp less than or equal to the given timestamp: 
The algorithm needs to be able to search for the key-value 
pair with the largest timestamp less than or equal to 
the given timestamp.

 6. Handling non-uniformly distributed timestamps:
The algorithm needs to be able to handle the case where the 
timestamps are not uniformly distributed.

 7. Time and space complexity: 
The algorithm needs to have a reasonable time and space complexity.

 8. Exporting the class: 
The algorithm needs to export the TimeMap class.

 9. Unit testing: 
The algorithm needs to have unit tests to ensure that it 
works correctly.


 4 D. Problem it is used to solve:
The Time-Based Key-Value Store problem is typically 
used to test a candidate's ability to design a data 
structure that can efficiently store and retrieve 
key-value pairs along with timestamps. It is a common 
problem that is used in coding interviews and competitions, 
as well as in computer science courses to teach concepts 
such as data structures, algorithms, and time complexity.

This problem is also related to the real-world use case of 
time-series data. Time-series data is a collection of data 
points that are collected and recorded at specific time 
intervals. Many systems, such as sensor networks, financial 
systems, and internet of things (IoT) devices, generate and 
store time-series data. Storing and querying this data efficiently
is an important task for many applications.

The Time-Based Key-Value Store problem can be seen as a 
simplified version of time-series data storage and retrieval 
problem. It tests the understanding of how to efficiently 
store key-value pairs with timestamps and retrieve the 
value of a key at a specific timestamp.
