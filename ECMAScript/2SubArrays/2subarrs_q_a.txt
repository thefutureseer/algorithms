Lucky for the reader as well as myself a common pattern within 
these Q & A files is so much repitition. I love it so far because 
you may learn this entire algorithm and never forget it by the 
time your done thinking through this Q & A file..


# Intuition / forethought
1. Before solving this problem, I would consider it to be a fairly 
   straightforward task that can be easily accomplished using a 
   loop and the slice() method. It requires a basic understanding 
   of array manipulation in JavaScript, and should not pose any 
   significant challenges.

   The instructions for solving this problem would involve 
   iterating over the elements of the input array, using the 
   slice() method to create a subarray of the desired size, 
   and adding the subarray to a list of subarrays. The loop 
   index would need to be advanced by the size of the subarray, 
   and a check would need to be included to handle the case where 
   the final subarray has fewer than the desired number of 
   elements.

# Approach
2. Describe your approach to solving the problem. 
  I would use a loop to iterate over the elements of the input array. 
  For each iteration, I would slice a subarray of the desired 
  size from the input array, and add it to the list of subarrays. 
  I would then advance the loop index by the size of the subarray, 
  so that the next iteration starts at the correct position in the
  input array.
  The final subarray may have fewer than the desired size if 
  there are not enough elements remaining in the input array. 
  In this case, I would add the remaining elements to a new 
  subarray and add it to the list of subarrays.

# Complexity
3 A. Time complexity:
  The time complexity of the solution I described, which uses a 
  single loop to create the subarrays, is O(n), where n is the 
  number of elements in the input array. This is because the loop 
  iterates over all the elements of the input array once, and the 
  slice operation is O(1).

  This means that the time taken by the algorithm increases 
  linearly with the size of the input array. For small arrays, 
  the algorithm will be very fast, but for large arrays it may 
  take longer to execute.

  In general, the time complexity of an algorithm is a measure of 
  how the running time of the algorithm increases as the size of 
  the input data increases. It is a useful way to compare the 
  efficiency of different algorithms, and to choose the most 
  appropriate algorithm for a given problem.

3 B. Space complexity:
  The space complexity of the solution I described, which uses a 
  single loop to create the subarrays, is O(m), where m is the 
  number of subarrays created. This is because the solution creates
  a new subarray for every size elements in the input array, and 
  the size of the subarray list increases linearly with the number
  of subarrays.

  In general, the space complexity of an algorithm is a measure of 
  how the amount of memory required by the algorithm increases as 
  the size of the input data increases. It is a useful way to 
  compare the efficiency of different algorithms, and to choose the
  most appropriate algorithm for a given problem.

  It's important to note that the space complexity of an algorithm 
  can sometimes be more important than the time complexity, 
  especially in resource-constrained environments such as mobile 
  devices or embedded systems.

4 A. Data structures:
  1. Arrays: The input array is used to store the original data, 
     and the subarray list is used to store the subarrays.
  2. Loops: A loop is used to iterate over the elements of the 
     input array and create the subarrays.
No other data structures are used in this solution.

#4 B. kind of algorithm:
      The solution I described is an example of an iterative 
   algorithm. An iterative algorithm is an algorithm that solves 
   a problem by repeating a process over and over until a certain 
   condition is met.

   In the case of the solution I described, the algorithm uses a 
   loop to iterate over the elements of the input array, creating 
   a new subarray for every size elements and adding it to the list
   of subarrays. The loop continues until all the elements of the 
   input array have been processed.

   Iterative algorithms are a common way to solve problems in 
   computer science, and they can be implemented using various 
   control structures such as loops, recursive functions, and 
   generators. They are often easier to understand and implement 
   than more complex algorithms, and can be an efficient choice 
   for solving many types of problems.
