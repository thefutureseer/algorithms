The first thing to think about 
when solving any algorithm is to understand the problem statement clearly. 
This involves reading and analyzing the problem statement, and identifying 
the input, output, 
and any constraints or requirements that the solution should meet.

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, 
the next step is to determine an appropriate algorithmic approach to solving it. 
This may involve breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, 
identifying patterns or regularities in the input data, or applying 
established algorithmic techniques or data structures to the problem.

After identifying the approach, 
the next step is to implement the algorithm in code. 
This involves writing the code in the appropriate programming language, ensuring 
that it meets the requirements of the problem, and testing it against sample 
inputs and edge cases to verify its correctness.

Finally, 
it is important to analyze the time and space complexity of the algorithm 
to ensure that it is efficient and scalable for larger input sizes.

Overall, 
the key to solving any algorithm is to approach it systematically and logically, 
and to break it down into smaller, more manageable steps.


PROBLEM SOLVING
1) Define the problem: 
Start by clearly defining the problem 
you are facing. Pinpoint the essence and 
subproblems. Identify what the problem 
is and why it is important to solve it.

2)Gather information: 
Once you have defined the problem, gather 
as much information as you can about it. 
Try to identify the causes and effects of 
the problem, and any relevant background 
information that could help you find a solution.

3)Analyze the information: 
After gathering information, analyze it to 
identify patterns and relationships. Look 
for any underlying causes or factors that 
may be contributing to the problem.

4)Brainstorm solutions: 
Generate a list of possible solutions. Be 
creative and don't be afraid to consider 
unconventional approaches. Remember to 
evaluate each solution based on its feasibility, 
effectiveness, and potential drawbacks.

5)Choose a solution: 
Based on your analysis and evaluation of potential 
solutions, select the most promising one.

6)Develop an action plan: 
Once you have chosen a solution, develop an action 
plan that outlines the steps you need to take to 
implement it. Identify any resources you need, and 
set timelines and deadlines for each step.

7)Take action: 
Implement the solution by following the action plan. 
Be flexible and willing to make adjustments as necessary.

8)Evaluate the results: 
After implementing the solution, evaluate the results to 
determine whether it was effective. If it was not, try 
to identify why and make any necessary adjustments. If it 
was successful, consider whether there are any further 
improvements that could be made.

Remember that problem-solving is an 
iterative process. You may need to 
repeat these steps multiple times before 
you find a satisfactory solution.


When trying to solve a difficult algorithm, 
the first thing I would do is to break down the problem into 
smaller, more manageable subproblems. Then I try to find 
solutions for each subproblem separately. Once I have solutions 
for all the subproblems, I try to combine them in order to 
solve the overall problem.

Additionally, I would check to see if there are any similar 
problems or solutions that have been previously published, 
and see if I can adapt those solutions to fit my problem.

I would also try to understand the time and space complexity of 
the problem and try to find an optimized solution.

Also a key is to test the implementation with sample test cases 
and debug them if needed.
