When trying to solve a difficult algorithm, 
the first thing I would do is to break down the problem into 
smaller, more manageable subproblems. Then I try to find 
solutions for each subproblem separately. Once I have solutions 
for all the subproblems, I try to combine them in order to 
solve the overall problem.

Additionally, I would check to see if there are any similar 
problems or solutions that have been previously published, 
and see if I can adapt those solutions to fit my problem.

I would also try to understand the time and space complexity of 
the problem and try to find an optimized solution.

Also a key is to test the implementation with sample test cases 
and debug them if needed.
