An AI algorithm is like a 
set of instructions that 
tells a computer how to do 
something all by itself, 
without a person telling it 
what to do every step of 
the way. It's like a recipe 
for a robot's brain that 
helps it learn and make 
decisions on its own, just 
like you learn and make 
decisions too. The robot 
follows the recipe to figure 
out how to do things like 
recognize pictures, talk 
like a person, or even play 
games. It's kind of like how 
you follow a recipe to make 
a cake or build a tower out 
of blocks.


A robot can figure out many 
different things depending on 
how it has been programmed and 
what kind of sensors it has. 
For example, a robot with a 
camera and image recognition 
algorithm can figure out what 
kind of object it is looking at, 
such as a cat or a car. A robot 
with a microphone and speech 
recognition algorithm can figure 
out what someone is saying to 
it and respond appropriately. 
A robot with sensors for 
temperature, humidity, and light 
can figure out the best conditions 
for growing plants. There are 
many other things a robot can 
figure out depending on its design 
and programming, and researchers 
are always working to improve 
their capabilities.

Here's an example of a simple AI 
algorithm called a decision tree, 
which can be used to make decisions 
based on a set of rules:

Let's say we have an AI algorithm to 
determine whether or not someone 
should go outside based on the weather. 
The decision tree might look something 
like this:

Is it raining? 
   /       \
 Yes        No
 /           \
Stay inside   Is it sunny?
              /        \
            Yes         No
            /           \
          Go outside   Stay inside


Is it raining?
Is it sunny?
Should you go outside or stay inside?
