Environment & 'State' for Q-Learning algorithm 

State:
A state represents the current 
configuration or condition of 
the environment at a particular 
moment in time. It captures all 
the relevant information that 
the agent needs to make decisions. 
The state can be thought of as 
the agent's perception or 
observation of the environment. 
It typically includes information 
about the agent's position, the 
environment's features, or any 
other relevant variables. The 
state provides the context for 
the agent to make decisions and 
influences the subsequent actions 
it takes. In essence, the state 
describes where the agent is in 
the environment.

Environment:
In the context of reinforcement 
learning, the environment is a 
system in which an agent operates. 
Each state represents a particular 
configuration or condition of the 
environment that the agent can be 
in. In the Q-Learning file, the 
environment has six possible states, 
numbered from 0 to 5.

EXAMPLE:
Imagine a simple grid-world environment 
where an agent can move in four directions: 
up, down, left, and right. The grid is 
represented by a 2D matrix, and each cell 
in the matrix represents a state in the 
environment.

Grid representation:
__________________
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|___|___|___|___|
| 4 |       | 6 |
|___|_______|___|

In this example, we have six states: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. State 5 is missing 
from the grid because it represents a hole 
or obstacle where the agent cannot move.

The agent can transition between states by 
taking actions (up, down, left, or right) 
and moving to neighboring cells. For example, 
if the agent is in state 0, it can move right 
to state 1 or down to state 4.

By defining the numStates variable as 6, the 
code indicates that there are six possible 
states in the environment. This information 
is essential for the reinforcement learning 
algorithm to know the range of valid states 
it can encounter and learn from during its 
interactions with the environment.

Environment & 'actions' for Q-Learning algorithm:


Action:
An action, represents the choices or decisions 
that the agent can take in a given state. It 
is the agent's response or behavior based on 
its current perception of the environment. 
Actions can be any specific operations, 
movements, or choices available to the 
agent. For example, in a grid-world environment, 
the actions can be moving up, down, left, or 
right. The action is the agent's way of 
interacting with the environment and exerting 
control over its future state.

In the context of reinforcement learning, 
the goal of the agent is to learn an optimal 
policy—a mapping from states to actions—that 
maximizes its cumulative reward over time. 
The agent learns to select actions based on 
the current state and the expected future 
rewards associated with different actions. 
It explores different actions in different 
states to learn which actions lead to better 
outcomes.

In summary, states describe the current 
condition of the environment, and actions 
represent the choices the agent can make 
in response to those states. The agent's 
goal is to learn a policy that determines 
the best actions to take in different states 
to maximize its long-term rewards.

In the example (in the Q-Learning folder), 
the number of possible actions is set to 
2. The choice of the number of possible 
actions depends on the specific problem 
and the actions available to the agent 
in the given environment.

In many grid-world or maze-like environments, 
such as the one described earlier, the agent 
typically has four possible actions: up, down, 
left, and right. However, in this particular 
example, two of the states (state 2 and state 3) 
do not have any valid actions. These states 
represent obstacles or unreachable areas in 
the grid where the agent cannot move. Therefore, 
the agent only has two valid actions in this 
environment.

By setting numActions to 2, the code indicates 
that there are two possible actions that the 
agent can take in the given environment. These 
actions could be mapped to specific movements 
such as "go left" and "go right" or any other 
meaningful actions based on the problem at hand.

It's important to note that the choice of the 
number of possible actions should align with 
the specifics of the problem and the available 
actions in the environment being modeled.
