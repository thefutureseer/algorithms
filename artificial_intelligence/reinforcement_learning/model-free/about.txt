In reinforcement learning, 
"model-free" refers to an 
approach where the agent 
learns to make decisions 
and improve its behavior 
directly from interacting 
with the environment without 
explicitly building a model 
or representation of the 
environment's dynamics.

In model-based reinforcement 
learning, the agent constructs 
a model of the environment, 
which includes the transition 
probabilities between states 
and the expected rewards 
associated with different 
state-action pairs. With 
this model, the agent can 
plan and simulate different 
scenarios to determine the 
optimal actions.

On the other hand, model-free 
reinforcement learning algorithms 
do not rely on an explicit model 
of the environment. Instead, they 
focus on learning an optimal policy 
by trial and error, through repeated 
interactions with the environment. 
The agent directly observes the 
states and rewards, and based on 
that information, it updates its 
policy or action-value estimates 
to maximize the cumulative reward 
over time.

Model-free algorithms, such as 
Q-learning and policy gradients, 
are generally more flexible and 
applicable in situations where 
the environment dynamics are 
complex or unknown. They can 
learn directly from raw sensory 
inputs, and their learning process 
is often more sample-efficient, as 
they do not require explicit modeling 
of the environment.

However, model-free algorithms 
can have limitations. They may 
require a larger number of 
interactions with the environment 
to converge, and they might struggle 
in domains with high-dimensional or 
continuous state and action spaces. 
Model-based approaches can sometimes 
be more efficient in terms of sample 
complexity but require accurate models 
of the environment, which can be 
challenging to obtain in practice.
