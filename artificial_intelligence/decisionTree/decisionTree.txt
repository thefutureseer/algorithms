DECISION TREE: 
Here's an example of a simple AI 
algorithm called a decision tree, 
which can be used to make decisions 
based on a set of rules:

Let's say we have an AI algorithm to 
determine whether or not someone 
should go outside based on the weather. 
The decision tree might look something 
like this:

Is it raining? 
   /       \
 Yes        No
 /           \
Stay inside   Is it sunny?
              /        \
            Yes         No
            /           \
          Go outside   Stay inside


Is it raining?
Is it sunny?
Should you go outside or stay inside?
