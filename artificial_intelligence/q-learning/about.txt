One simple reinforcement 
learning algorithm that 
can be implemented using 
JavaScript is the Q-
learning algorithm. Q-
learning is a model-free, 
value-based algorithm that 
learns an optimal policy 
through trial and error.

In the example in this folder, 
the environment is represented 
by a grid with six states (0 to 
5) and two possible actions (0 
and 1). The rewards matrix 
defines the immediate rewards 
for transitioning between states.

The algorithm initializes the 
Q-values for each state-action 
pair and then iterates over a 
number of episodes. In each 
episode, the agent starts in 
a random state and takes actions 
based on the current Q-values, 
updating the Q-values after each 
action.

After the Q-learning algorithm 
completes, the learned Q-values 
and the optimal path from state 
0 to state 5 are printed to the 
console.

Please note that this is a simplified 
implementation and may not be suitable 
for complex problems. Additionally, 
depending on the complexity of your 
problem, you might want to consider 
using a library like TensorFlow.js 
or ReinforceJS, which provide more 
advanced reinforcement learning 
functionalities.
