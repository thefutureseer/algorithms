Facebook is known for conducting technical interviews that assess a candidate's problem-solving skills, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering abilities. While the specific questions asked can vary, here are some common algorithms and data structures that are frequently tested during Facebook interviews:

1. **Binary Search**: Understanding and implementing binary search is fundamental. Candidates may be asked to apply binary search to solve various problems, such as finding elements in a sorted array or optimizing search in a data structure.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: You may be asked to perform these traversal algorithms on graphs or trees, or to solve related problems.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Expect questions that involve dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions, like solving the Fibonacci sequence, the knapsack problem, or variations of the longest common subsequence problem.

4. **Graph Algorithms**: Understanding and applying graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, or topological sorting can be important, especially if you're interviewing for a role that deals with social network graphs.

5. **Hashing**: Understanding how hash tables work, collision resolution strategies, and solving problems using hash maps.

6. **Sorting Algorithms**: Knowledge of sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or understanding when to use them in different scenarios.

7. **Tree Algorithms**: Familiarity with binary trees, binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, and solving problems involving these data structures.

8. **Bit Manipulation**: Solving problems that involve bitwise operations, like finding the single non-duplicate element in an array or implementing efficient data storage structures.

9. **Greedy Algorithms**: Applying greedy algorithms to solve optimization problems.

10. **Recursion**: Understanding recursive algorithms and solving problems using recursion.

11. **Linked Lists**: Knowledge of singly and doubly linked lists, and solving problems related to them.

12. **Trie Data Structure**: Understanding and implementing tries, especially for string-related problems.

13. **Sliding Window Technique**: Applying this technique to solve substring or subarray problems efficiently.

14. **Two-Pointers Technique**: Solving problems that involve two-pointer manipulation in arrays or lists.

15. **Divide and Conquer**: Understanding and applying this technique to solve problems efficiently.

16. **System Design**: While not strictly an algorithm, you may be asked to design a system or discuss the architecture of a large-scale distributed system.

Facebook interviews can be highly competitive, and the difficulty of questions can vary based on the specific role you're applying for. It's essential to not only understand these algorithms but also practice solving problems that utilize these concepts. Additionally, Facebook may also evaluate your coding skills, problem-solving approach, and ability to optimize algorithms and data structures for performance and scalability. Mock interviews and online coding platforms can be valuable resources for preparation.
