OMEGA ( Ω )

The Ω (omega) symbol that mathematicians use to talk about lower bounds 
actually comes from the last letter of the Greek alphabet , which 
is a set of letters that Greek people used to write many years 
ago. The letter Ω is pronounced "omega" and looks like a squiggly
"W". Mathematicians use this letter to talk about lower bounds 
because it looks like an upside-down "V", which kind of represents 
a lower limit or floor. So, just like how we use the letter "A" 
to start words like "apple" or "animal", mathematicians use the 
letter Ω to talk about lower bounds.

Mathematicians use the Ω to talk about how long it takes for 
some problems to be solved. It helps us know how much time we 
need to spend to finish a task, and how hard the task is to 
complete.

When you see the symbol Ω next to an algorithm, it means that the 
algorithm needs at least a certain amount of time to solve a 
problem. Just like how some puzzles are really hard and take a 
long time to finish, some problems are also really hard for a 
computer to solve and take a long time. The Ω helps us understand 
how much time the algorithm needs to solve a problem, so we can 
choose the best algorithm to use.
