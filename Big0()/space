Runtime complexity works similarly to space complexity"

~Space complexity~

Defined:
How much space or memory the program takes to complete the task.

Selection sort:
It has a space complexity of O(1)
  1) It stores one minimum value and its index for comparison. The maximum space used 
      does not increase w/ input size

Bucket sort: 
It has a space complexity of O(n) & Runtime of O(1)
  1) It chops down time complexity
  2) "Buckets" of each
