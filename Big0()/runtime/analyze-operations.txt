In JavaScript, we can break 
down the runtime complexity 
of an algorithm by analyzing 
the number of basic operations 
performed by the algorithm as 
a function of the input size. 
Here are some common ways to 
analyze runtime complexity in 
JavaScript:

Counting iterations: 
If an algorithm involves iterating 
over a data structure, such as an 
array or a tree, we can count the 
number of iterations as a function 
of the input size. For example, if 
we are iterating over an array of 
length n, the number of iterations 
would be n.

Counting comparisons: 
If an algorithm involves comparing 
values, such as in a sorting algorithm, 
we can count the number of comparisons 
as a function of the input size. For 
example, if we are sorting an array of 
length n, the number of comparisons 
would be proportional to n^2 for a 
quadratic sorting algorithm.

Analyzing recursion: 
If an algorithm is recursive, 
we can analyze the number of 
recursive calls as a function 
of the input size. For example, 
in a binary search algorithm, 
the number of recursive calls 
would be proportional to the 
logarithm of the input size.

Using built-in methods: 
In JavaScript, many built-in methods, 
such as Array.sort(), have a known 
runtime complexity. We can leverage 
these methods in our algorithms to 
improve performance.

Analyzing nested loops: 
If an algorithm involves nested loops, 
we can analyze the number of basic 
operations performed by the inner 
loop as a function of the input 
size. For example, if we have two 
nested loops that iterate over an 
array of length n, the number of 
basic operations would be proportional 
to n^2.

Using memoization: 
If an algorithm involves recursive 
calls, we can use memoization to 
cache the results of previous calls 
and avoid redundant computations. 
This can significantly improve the 
performance of recursive algorithms.

Avoiding unnecessary operations: 
In JavaScript, some operations can be 
more expensive than others. For example, 
accessing elements in an array using a 
loop index is faster than using the 
Array.slice() method. By avoiding 
unnecessary operations and optimizing 
our code, we can improve the runtime 
complexity of our algorithms.

Considering the input data: 
The runtime complexity of an algorithm 
can vary depending on the characteristics 
of the input data. For example, some 
sorting algorithms perform better on 
partially sorted data than on unsorted 
data. It is important to consider the 
expected characteristics of the input 
data when analyzing runtime complexity.
