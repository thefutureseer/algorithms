   NOTE ONE WAY TO DO LOGARITHMS:

A logarithm is a mathematical function that represents the exponent to which a fixed number (called the base "log_base(target)") must be raised to obtain another number (target). In other words, it helps you find the power to which a base number must be raised to get a certain result.

Here's how the notation works:

The general formula for a logarithm with base b is:

log_b(x) = y

This equation can be interpreted as "b raised to the power of y equals x."

Logarithms have many applications in mathematics, science, engineering, and various fields, including solving exponential equations, analyzing data, and modeling phenomena with exponential growth or decay. They are also commonly used in algorithms and computer science for various calculations.
