Relation of data structure to algorithms:

Sorting: 
Algorithms such as quicksort, merge sort, and heapsort 
all use arrays as the underlying data structure. 
These algorithms partition and rearrange the elements in the array 
to put them in a sorted order.

Searching: 
Algorithms such as linear search and binary search 
can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. These algorithms 
look for a specific value in a collection of elements.

Graph traversal: 
Algorithms such as breadth-first search and 
depth-first search can be implemented using graph data structures 
such as an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.

Shortest path: 
Algorithm like Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford and others require the use 
of priority queue, which is commonly implemented as a heap.

Huffman coding: 
It uses the binary tree, to store the frequency of characters.

Hash-based search: 
The hash table data structure is used in many algorithms such as 
Hash-based search and many other lookups based on key-value pair
