--     This solution defines a Path type as a list of Direction values, and a dirReduc function that takes a Path and returns a reduced version of the path.

-- The dirReduc function uses a fold to iterate over the input list of directions, and a helper function called reduce to determine whether each direction should be included in the output path or not. The reduce function checks whether the current direction is opposite to the first element of the output path (which is the last direction that was added to the path). If it is, then the first element of the output path is removed (since it is cancelled out by the current direction), and the current direction is not added to the output path. If the current direction is not opposite to the first element of the output path, then it is added to the beginning of the output path.

-- The opposite function is used to check whether two directions are opposite to each other. It returns True if the directions are opposite, and False otherwise.

-- Here is an example of how you can use the dirReduc function:
