Encoding/Decoding (Crypto & Safe Storage)
Why it matters: Protecting user credentials, API keys, and session tokens.

Algorithms:

Base64 encoding/decoding

Hashing (SHA-256, bcrypt simulation)

XOR encryption simulation

Example Interview Questions:

Simulate token signing and verification.

Compare two password hashes safely (constant-time comparison).

Encode user credentials using a safe hashing scheme.
