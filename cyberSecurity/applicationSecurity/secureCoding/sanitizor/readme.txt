String Matching & Sanitization

Why it matters: Preventing XSS, SQL injection, path traversal, and more.

Algorithms:

Substring search (includes, KMP, Rabin-Karp)

Regex parsing and escaping

Trie (for blacklist/whitelist matching)


Example interview Questions:

Detect if user input contains dangerous characters or keywords.

Write a regex to validate email/sanitize URL paths.

Build a Trie to detect disallowed API paths (e.g., /admin, /internal).
