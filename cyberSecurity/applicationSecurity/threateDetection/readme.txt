Hashing & Hash Tables
Why it matters: Storing and checking unique sessions, tokens, or inputs.

Algorithms:

Custom hash map

Collision detection

Bloom filters (e.g., for caching or fast set lookups)

Example interview Questions:

Implement a token blacklist system using hashing.

Detect duplicate login sessions.

Use a Bloom Filter to check if a token has already been seen.
