#1 Intuition, forethought & 
first thoughts on how to solve this problem:
  a. Intuition: 
      Intuition as instinctive understanding or gut 
      feeling about the problem. It comes from previous 
      experiences, knowledge, and patterns observed. 
      Intuition can help guide you in making initial 
      assumptions or identifying potential solutions 
      based on your subconscious understanding of the 
      problem.
  b. Forethought:
      Forethought involves thinking ahead and 
      considering different aspects of the problem. 
      It involves planning, anticipating challenges, 
      and envisioning potential solutions. Forethought 
      can help you prepare a strategy, break down the 
      problem into manageable parts, and foresee any 
      potential roadblocks or considerations.
  c. First Thoughts: 
      First thoughts are the initial ideas or approaches 
      that come to your mind when you encounter a problem. 
      They can be spontaneous and based on your immediate 
      understanding of the problem. First thoughts are 
      valuable because they give you a starting point to 
      work from and can help trigger further exploration 
      and analysis.
