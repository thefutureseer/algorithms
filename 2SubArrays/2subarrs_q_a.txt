# Intuition / forethought
1. Before solving this problem, I would consider it to be a fairly 
   straightforward task that can be easily accomplished using a 
   loop and the slice() method. It requires a basic understanding 
   of array manipulation in JavaScript, and should not pose any 
   significant challenges.

   The instructions for solving this problem would involve 
   iterating over the elements of the input array, using the 
   slice() method to create a subarray of the desired size, 
   and adding the subarray to a list of subarrays. The loop 
   index would need to be advanced by the size of the subarray, 
   and a check would need to be included to handle the case where 
   the final subarray has fewer than the desired number of 
   elements.

# Approach
2. Describe your approach to solving the problem. 
  I would use a loop to iterate over the elements of the input array. 
  For each iteration, I would slice a subarray of the desired 
  size from the input array, and add it to the list of subarrays. 
  I would then advance the loop index by the size of the subarray, 
  so that the next iteration starts at the correct position in the
  input array.
  The final subarray may have fewer than the desired size if 
  there are not enough elements remaining in the input array. 
  In this case, I would add the remaining elements to a new 
  subarray and add it to the list of subarrays.
