# Intuition
1. Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. 
  I would use a loop to iterate over the elements of the input array. 
  For each iteration, I would slice a subarray of the desired 
  size from the input array, and add it to the list of subarrays. 
  I would then advance the loop index by the size of the subarray, 
  so that the next iteration starts at the correct position in the
  input array.
  The final subarray may have fewer than the desired size if 
  there are not enough elements remaining in the input array. 
  In this case, I would add the remaining elements to a new 
  subarray and add it to the list of subarrays.
